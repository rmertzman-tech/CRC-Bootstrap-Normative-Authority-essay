            <p class="text-gray-700">How can agents with fundamentally different belief systems, values, and cognitive architectures coordinate normatively without imposing uniformity? This paper proposes a capability-based approach to normative coordination that grounds ethical requirements in the practical constraints of temporal agency rather than shared moral content. Drawing on modal logic and convergent evidence across psychedelic therapy, neuroscience, and cross-cultural coordination, I argue that normative authority emerges through what I call the "bootstrap resolution"—the performative necessity that any agent capable of asking normative questions already demonstrates commitment to the temporal coherence requirements that ground ethical coordination.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">The resulting framework enables coordination across diverse Personal Reality Frameworks through three universal principles: capability-based propositions, temporal coherence functions, and cross-scale markup organization. This approach dissolves classical metaethical dilemmas by showing how objective normative coordination can emerge from subjective agent architectures through practical necessity rather than metaphysical derivation. The framework's mathematical formalization through Adaptive Temporal Coherence Functions (ATCF) provides empirical criteria for normative validity while maintaining agnosticism about contested metaphysical questions.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">1.1 The Persistent Gap Between Formal and Lived Normativity</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Consider a scenario reflecting typical patterns in international climate negotiations: Delegations from small island nations, confronting existential sea-level rise, operate from frameworks prioritizing immediate survival and intergenerational justice. Representatives from major developing economies approach negotiations through long-term economic development models emphasizing gradual transitions. Negotiators from established democracies work within frameworks requiring domestic political viability. Each group possesses sophisticated reasoning, legitimate concerns, and coherent value systems—yet they struggle to coordinate effectively despite shared recognition of climate urgency.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">This scenario exemplifies a fundamental challenge facing contemporary philosophy and practice: how can agents with fundamentally different belief systems, values, and cognitive architectures coordinate normatively without imposing artificial uniformity on their diverse perspectives? Traditional approaches assume coordination requires either shared content (impossible across such different frameworks) or acceptance of pure relativism (unhelpful for urgent collective action).</p>
            <p class="mb-4"><em>Phenomenological accounts</em> emphasize that normativity emerges from lived experience (Merleau-Ponty, 1945; Darwall, 2006), capturing the essential insight that ethical requirements arise within embodied, contextual agency. However, they struggle to generate precise coordination mechanisms across diverse agents or provide formal tools for institutional design.</p>
            <p class="mb-4"><em>Formal capability models</em> in AI ethics and computational philosophy (Floridi, 2011; Russell, 2019) offer rigorous tools for strategic interaction modeling. Yet they typically assume pre-specified goals, neglecting how capability perception itself is filtered through what I call Personal Reality Frameworks—the interpretive structures that make normativity meaningful to particular agents.</p>
            <p class="mb-4"><em>Predictive processing frameworks</em> (Friston, 2010; Clark, 2016) successfully explain individual cognition but struggle with coordination across agents with different predictive hierarchies (Miller et al., 2022). The challenge remains: how can agents with different models achieve meaningful coordination without reducing to either content realism or framework relativism?</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">1.2 The Capability-Based Solution: Beyond Content to Functional Equivalence</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">This paper proposes a capability-based approach that bridges this gap through a novel integration of modal logic, temporal coherence requirements, and empirical validation. The core insight is that normative coordination can be achieved through <em>capability equivalence</em> rather than <em>content agreement</em>—agents need not share identical beliefs, values, or cognitive architectures to coordinate effectively, but they must possess equivalent capabilities for temporal coherence and responsive coordination.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Consider a simple example: Agent A might approach social situations through individualistic frameworks emphasizing personal autonomy, while Agent B operates through collectivistic frameworks emphasizing group harmony. Traditional approaches assume these agents cannot coordinate normatively without either abandoning their differences (impossible) or accepting pure relativism (unhelpful for coordination). The capability-based approach suggests they can coordinate effectively if both possess equivalent capabilities for:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 pl-4 space-y-2">
                <li>Recognizing others' contributions and needs</li>
                <li>Adapting behavior based on feedback</li>
                <li>Maintaining consistent responses over time</li>
                <li>Preserving their authentic identity while enabling cooperation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This shifts focus from aligning cognitive content (impossible across different frameworks) to aligning coordination capabilities (achievable through capability equivalence).</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">1.3 The Bootstrap Resolution of Normative Authority</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">The framework's most significant philosophical contribution addresses the classical problem of normative authority: why should agents follow any normative requirements at all? Rather than grounding normativity in abstract moral facts or arbitrary social contracts, I propose that normative requirements <em>bootstrap</em> from the performative necessities of temporal agency itself.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Any agent capable of asking "why should I be ethical?" already demonstrates their commitment to:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 pl-4 space-y-2">
                <li>Maintaining consistent reasoning patterns across time</li>
                <li>Connecting past experiences to present decisions</li>
                <li>Projecting coherent intentions into future action</li>
                <li>Engaging in meaningful discourse with other agents</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4">An entity lacking these capacities is not a "morally deficient agent"—it simply ceases to function as an agent capable of asking normative questions at all. The normativity emerges from within agency itself as the practical requirements for continued ethical capacity.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">This <em>bootstrap resolution</em> avoids both the metaphysical commitments of moral realism and the coordination failures of relativism by grounding objective normative requirements in the subjective structural necessities of temporal agency. The resulting framework provides what I call <em>agent-relative objectivity</em>—normative requirements that are empirically measurable and coordination-enabling while remaining grounded in the authentic perspectives of diverse agents.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">1.4 Structure and Scope</h3>
            <p>Section II develops the conceptual foundations, focusing on Personal Reality Frameworks and the mathematical formalization of temporal coherence. Section III presents the bootstrap resolution argument and demonstrates its compatibility with deterministic frameworks. Section IV addresses core philosophical objections systematically. Section V examines convergent empirical evidence from neuroscience, psychology, and cross-cultural coordination research. Section VI explores applications to AI ethics, institutional design, and therapeutic intervention. Section VII concludes with implications for future research in normative theory.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">II. Conceptual Foundations: Personal Reality Frameworks and Temporal Coherence</h2>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">2.1 Personal Reality Frameworks: The Architecture of Lived Normativity</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Human agents are not disembodied minds contemplating eternal truths, but complex, temporally extended, recursively self-modifying organisms embedded in biological, social, and ecological contexts. Their agency is enacted over time through repeated cycles of perception, interpretation, evaluation, and action. This temporally embodied nature is not incidental to normativity—it is foundational to the emergence of normative requirements.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">A <em>Personal Reality Framework (PRF)</em> encompasses the structured architecture through which an agent organizes their lived experience and coordinates with their environment. Unlike static belief systems, PRFs are dynamically updated through predictive interaction with environment and other agents. They emerge from the structural constraints of maintaining coherent agency over time rather than from abstract reflection alone.</p>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Formal Structure:</strong> A PRF consists of four integrated components:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 pl-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Beliefs (B):</strong> Probabilistic assignments over propositions about the world, including expectations about causal relationships, other agents' behaviors, and environmental patterns. These are not mere intellectual commitments but embodied expectations that guide action.</li>
                <li><strong>Rules (R):</strong> Conditional structures governing inference and action, including decision-making heuristics, moral principles, and practical wisdom acquired through experience. These provide the procedural knowledge for navigating complex situations.</li>
                <li><strong>Ontological commitments (O):</strong> Fundamental categories structuring experience, including concepts of personhood, causation, time, value, and meaning. These create the conceptual framework within which beliefs and rules operate.</li>
                <li><strong>Authenticity criteria (A+):</strong> Standards for evaluating alignment with core identity, including values, aspirations, and integrity requirements. These determine what kinds of choices and changes preserve versus threaten the agent's sense of authentic selfhood.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Mathematical Representation:</strong></p>
            <p class="mb-4 font-mono bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-md">PRF(A,t) = ⟨BROA+(t), C(t), ATCF(t), XSC(t), FOP(t)⟩</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Where:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 pl-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>BROA+(t)</strong> = current belief, rule, ontological, and authenticity configuration</li>
                <li><strong>C(t)</strong> = capability specifications for coordination</li>
                <li><strong>ATCF(t)</strong> = Adaptive Temporal Coherence Function (defined below)</li>
                <li><strong>XSC(t)</strong> = cross-scale correspondence patterns</li>
                <li><strong>FOP(t)</strong> = future-oriented projections</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4">This formalization maintains agnosticism about contested metaphysical questions. We make no claims about the ultimate nature of consciousness, free will, or personal identity. The PRF is a <em>functional model</em> that tracks coordination patterns across whatever constitutes an agent's decision-making architecture, whether that architecture is deterministic, emergent, individual, collective, or something yet unconsidered.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">2.2 Temporal Coherence and the ATCF</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">The crucial insight is that normative requirements emerge from the coherence requirements for maintaining agency over time. An agent maintaining coherent agency over time must integrate past experience, present awareness, and future intention in ways that preserve identity while enabling adaptation.</p>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Definition 2.2:</strong> The <em>Adaptive Temporal Coherence Function (ATCF)</em> measures an agent's capacity to maintain identity integration across temporal scales:</p>
            <p class="mb-4 font-mono bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-md">ATCF(A, t₁, t₂) = f( HistoricalContinuity(t₀ → t₁), PresentIntegration(t₁), ProspectiveCoherence(t₁ → t₂), MetaConstructorCapacity(t₁) )</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Where each component measures specific aspects of temporal agency:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 pl-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Historical Continuity:</strong> The agent's capacity to maintain narrative connections between past and present, preserving identity kernel structures that enable recognition and trust while integrating learning and growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Present Integration:</strong> The degree to which the agent's current beliefs, emotions, intentions, and actions form a coherent whole, avoiding destructive fragmentation while accommodating productive complexity.</li>
                <li><strong>Prospective Coherence:</strong> Alignment between the agent's future-oriented projections and their identity kernel, ensuring that projected development enhances rather than threatens authentic selfhood.</li>
                <li><strong>Meta-Constructor Capacity:</strong> The agent's ability to modify their own PRF architecture while maintaining coherence—the crucial capacity for authentic development and responsive coordination.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4 p-4 bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400"><strong>Technical Implementation Note:</strong> The ATCF enables empirical measurement of coordination patterns while maintaining agnosticism about the metaphysical nature of identity. Whether the "identity kernel" represents an individual soul, a collective consensus, a distributed network property, or a purely functional pattern is irrelevant to the framework's operation. What matters is that whatever constitutes the agent demonstrates these coordination capabilities across time.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Having established how normativity emerges from temporal coherence requirements, we must clarify the scope of this emergence. In this framework, normative authority emerges not from metaphysical fiat, but from the recursive coherence constraints that govern agentic survival, learning, and coordination. These constraints manifest differently at various layers of the agent's modeling and action architecture.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">We propose a triadic typology of normativity—epistemic, ethical, and semantic—each arising from distinct but interrelated facets of capability-based coordination:</p>
